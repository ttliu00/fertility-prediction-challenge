# This is an example script to generate the outcome variable given the input dataset.
# 
# This script should be modified to prepare your own submission that predicts 
# the outcome for the benchmark challenge by changing the clean_df and predict_outcomes function.
# 
# The predict_outcomes function takes a data frame. The return value must
# be a data frame with two columns: nomem_encr and outcome. The nomem_encr column
# should contain the nomem_encr column from the input data frame. The outcome
# column should contain the predicted outcome for each nomem_encr. The outcome
# should be 0 (no child) or 1 (having a child).
# 
# clean_df should be used to clean (preprocess) the data.
# 
# run.R can be used to test your submission.

# List your packages here. Don't forget to update packages.R!

  ### If no cleaning is done (e.g. if all the cleaning is done in a pipeline) leave only the "return df" command
  
  # Parameters:
  # df (dataframe): The input dataframe containing the raw data (e.g., from PreFer_train_data.csv or PreFer_fake_data.csv).
  # background (dataframe): Optional input dataframe containing background data (e.g., from PreFer_train_background_data.csv or PreFer_fake_background_data.csv).

  # Returns:
  # data frame: The cleaned dataframe with only the necessary columns and processed variables.
